Regression analysis is a widely-used technique for fitting known-type functions to data sets for the purposes of making accurate, generalizable projections. But what can we do if we do not know the type of function the data represents? Symbolic regression, using a genetic algorithm, is one way to answer this question. We apply evolutionary principles to this problem by treating a generated set of diverse expression trees (determined as fit by a fitness function) as "parents," combining traits between probabilistically chosen pairs to render a child set, and repeating over the course of several generations to produce a well-fitting function. This methodology is used to develop expression trees fitting two different sets of data which represent unknown functions. Through manipulation of the data, one data set was successfully solved, but the algorithm was unable to solve a higher-dimensional data set, for which data visualization is not functional.
