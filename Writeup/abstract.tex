An 8-puzzle is a tile puzzle which is solved by rearranging tiles via sliding to reach an ordered goal configuration.  We use the A* local search algorithm to solve the 8-puzzle, comparing the behavior and efficiency of 3 heuristic functions in order to evaluate the difference in puzzle generation cost and effective branching factor.  The heuristics used evaluate, respectively, the number of out-of-place tiles, the minimum number of moves needed for each tile to reach its goal position, and the sum of the minimum number of moves and total linear conflict, which is the number of out-of-order tile conflicts in each row and column.
