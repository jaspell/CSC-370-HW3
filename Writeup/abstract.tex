The classic and simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, also known by Roshambo, is a cyclic, zero-sum two player game with an established and easy to determine Nash equilibrium.  However, players using the Nash equilibrium mixed strategy (random choices between each of the three moves) will, on average, always tie opponents.  Thus, it is advantageous for players to employ an adaptive strategy which searches for, and exploits, non-random strategies in its opponents.  We describe the creation of a regret-minimization algorithm to compete against opponent algorithms in Rock-Paper-Scissors.
