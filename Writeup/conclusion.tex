\label{sec:concl}

In this experiment, we used a genetic algorithm for symbolic regression against two unknown goal functions.  We developed a population of expression trees through 50 generations by evaluating the trees' fitness via their error against the goal function.  Though this approach did not autonomously solve the goal functions, data manipulation -- in the form of taking the reciprocal of the output of the goal function -- allowed the algorithm to correctly solve one of the functions.  While the variability and potential solving power of genetic programming can seem a catch-all solution, our results indicate that careful data analysis may be needed to supplement the algorithm in order for it to be effective.  This problem deserves further research by this team in order to determine a more robust solution to the single input problem and to solve the more complex three input problem.  Allowing some proportion of each generation to continue unaltered into the next generation may allow the algorithm to maintain accurate functions and therefore converge more effectively when it finds approximate solutions.
