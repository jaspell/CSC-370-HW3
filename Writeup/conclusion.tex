\label{sec:concl}

Though a fitting choice against Rock-Paper-Scissors opponents employing a fixed mixed strategy, the regret minimization algorithm does not fare well in competition with more adaptable non-fixed algorithms.  The regret minimization algorithm described in this paper is significantly outperformed by most other algorithms tested, which are designed for competitive use.  At fundamental fault is this algorithm's need for a relatively static opponent strategy, which cannot adjust quickly nor accurately enough to avoid predictable play.  The authors recommend historical prediction or meta-strategy algorithms when designing for head-to-head competitive Rock-Paper-Scissors, as well as for any game with quickly changing opponent strategies.
