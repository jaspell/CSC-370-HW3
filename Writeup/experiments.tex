\label{sec:expts}

We compare our algorithm against several algorithms produced by classmates by competing algorithms in pairs for $10$ rounds of $10000$ games against each opponent.  Algorithms are compared via their average performance, measured by the average margin of victory over the $10$ rounds in order to avoid chance performance fluctuations.

Opponent algorithms can be grouped, based on general technique, into 6 categories.  Six algorithms use meta-strategies, which evaluate a number of approaches and choose the best anticipated approach.  2 algorithms use historical prediction, which looks back into the opponents history to check what the opponent played after similar preceding moves.  2 algorithms use frequency analysis to predict what the opponent will most likely play next.  3 algorithms simply use static mixed strategies, one uses reinforcement learning, and one chooses from a preset list of 3-move play sequences known as gambits.

%In this section, you should describe your experimental setup. What
%were the questions you were trying to answer? What was the
%experimental setup (number of trials, parameter settings, etc.)? What
%were you measuring? You should justify these choices when
%necessary. The accepted wisdom is that there should be enough detail
%in this section that I could reproduce your work \emph{exactly} if I
%were so motivated.
